# Project coordination guidance index

The coordination rules live in the files below, split by role and capability.
The llm-bus CLI and hooks print the files that apply to a session in
`guidance_files`; the skill's `SKILL.md` dispatch says when to load them. Files
sit under `references/coordination/` and are loaded relative to this file.

A full read of this reference means every file in the table, in order. Use it
when the installed skill and the CLI disagree, when a named file is missing, or
when guidance output does not name files. `core.md` starts with a
guidance-version marker that must match the CLI's `guidance_version`.

| File | Load when |
| --- | --- |
| [coordination/core.md](coordination/core.md) | Always, first, in every role and state. |
| [coordination/coordinator.md](coordination/coordinator.md) | Active coordinator, and before `coordinate`. |
| [coordination/worker.md](coordination/worker.md) | Active worker, and before `join`. |
| [coordination/gates.md](coordination/gates.md) | Gates are delegated or bound. |
| [coordination/auto-merge.md](coordination/auto-merge.md) | `auto-merge` is delegated or bound. |
| [coordination/owner-decisions.md](coordination/owner-decisions.md) | Owner decisions or decision defaults are delegated or bound. |
| [coordination/remote-coordination.md](coordination/remote-coordination.md) | A worker's coordinator is remote, a coordinator has a configured peer, or a receiver `setup` import. |
| [coordination/memory-snapshot.md](coordination/memory-snapshot.md) | Before a coordinator rewrites the memory ticket (named by `coordinator.md`). |
| [coordination/recovery.md](coordination/recovery.md) | Inactive state, recovery, and before `replace`, `revoke` or `leave`. |

## Installation and rollback

Follow the repository [installation guide](https://github.com/wnz99/llm-bus#install-and-verify).
CLI installation, host hooks, shared skill copying and standing instructions are
separate actions. Discover the shared skill directory (normally
`~/.agents/skills/llm-bus/`) and copy the whole skill directory. Install the
official Beads skill separately; optional caveman separately. Ask project/global
instruction destination before edits, then follow the
[agent instruction install guide](https://github.com/wnz99/llm-bus/blob/main/examples/agent-instructions.md). Preserve settings; never auto-trust hooks
or relax host/remote permissions. Install hooks per machine and custom host home,
restart hosts, and let the owner review/trust native hooks.

Before removing recovery tooling, revoke relevant grants/projects on each
machine. `llm-bus uninstall` removes bus hooks, Claude allow rule and uv tool;
mailbox, grants and native-home bindings remain. Remove copied skills, rule files
and pointer blocks separately only on owner request. Stop bridges and back up before client rollback:
schema 13 mailboxes reject older clients, and old transports cannot carry directions.
The first command run by a client with delegated gates upgrades the mailbox to
schema version 13 (additive tables only); older binaries then refuse it, so
upgrade every llm-bus installation that shares the mailbox (`uv run llm-bus
upgrade` from a checkout) before any session uses it.
