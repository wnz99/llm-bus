# Remote coordinator, local worker

Load with `core.md` when the project's coordinator address is remote (a worker),
or when the repository config lists a peer (a coordinator).

Gate records, auto-merge, owner decisions, standing instructions and objective
amendments are local-project data: they stay on the coordinator machine, and
remote addresses get no decision notices and cannot be a `--worker`. Remote gate
approvals exist (below). The roles the bus enforces on the receiver are in
`core.md`.

Each owner independently configures relay repository admission, matching shared
repository ID, sender text permission, receiver `inbox` permission and running
bridges; see [../remote.md](../remote.md). Remote coordination also requires version 1
coordination transport support on both clients and relay. Sender permission has
no reciprocal effect. `--cross-folder` cannot bypass remote restrictions.

Receiver owner imports the coordinator's project UUID, generation UUID and exact
authenticated qualified address. Local paths belong to the receiver:

```sh
llm-bus --format agent coordination setup PROJECT --project-id PROJECT_UUID --generation GENERATION_UUID --coordinator MACHINE/REPO/codex:COORDINATOR_ID --objective 'Owner-approved objective' --beads-workspace /absolute/local/project --memory-ticket MEMORY_ID --reference /absolute/local/project/AGENTS.md
llm-bus --format agent join PROJECT
```

`setup` cannot overwrite an existing binding. Matching upgraded clients and relay
exchange structured availability automatically, installing the exact target only
for the current binding. Relay migration `0006_coordination_availability.sql` must
precede the matching Worker deployment. Unsupported relays leave availability
queued with `unsupported_availability`; never strip metadata to bypass it.
No deployment or trust change follows from join, and a join never establishes
trust in an unknown remote coordinator: remote coordinators also need the
receiving machine owner's approval of the project binding. Advanced explicit grants remain
available. For an older compatible direction transport, exchange the non-secret returned
recipient grant UUID out of band or as ordinary data. Coordinator stores it with
`coordination target PROJECT --recipient MACHINE/REPO/claude:WORKER_ID --grant-id GRANT_UUID`,
then sends with the same paired direction flags. Claimed IDs cannot authorize
the receiver. Local receive policy and current local grant must both allow
delivery; monitor/report channels never become agent assignment channels.

## Remote gate approvals

A remote coordinator's `coordination approve` reaches the worker only when every
side allows it; no side can grant another's permission:

- Coordinator owner: its own project delegation covers the gate, the base
  target and expiry, and the work branch is not a target. Checked at `approve`
  and again at each upload, so `amend` narrowing, `replace` or expiry holds the
  queued approval (`queued_local`; it is never resent as ordinary text).
- Receiver owner: imports the project with `setup ... --delegate GATE:BRANCH`
  (gate specs only), and sets `accept_delegated_gates` for that coordinator's
  machine in the local peer policy (omitted means deny). The worker's own `join`
  binding (optionally `--narrow`) must also cover the gate. The approval must
  expire within 24 hours of admission.
- Relay: version 1 `GET /v2/coordination/approvals/capabilities`; migration
  `0007_coordination_approvals.sql` precedes the Worker deployment. Otherwise
  the approval stays queued with `unsupported_approvals`.

After a receiver-local `replace`, the receiver owner runs
`coordination amend PROJECT --delegate GATE:BRANCH` (or `--no-delegation`;
narrowing applies at once), then each worker owner rejoins. On a
remote-coordinated project `amend` accepts only those two options; the
coordinator owner re-declares its own delegation with `amend` on its machine.
